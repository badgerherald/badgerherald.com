# Contributing to Web

Exa is an open source platform maintained primarily by students at [The Badger Herald](https://badgerherald.com). We'd love your contributions!

This page will give you a rundown of how you can start contributing.

### General design principles:

1. Keep code maintainable and flexible.
2. Keep code organized.
3. Think critically about how data is stored.
4. Keep it simple, make it easy for new contributors to get started.

### [Pattern driven markup](https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/):

> _Each page of the site is, as you might guess, stitched together from a host of tiny, reusable patterns. Some of them, like the search form and footer, are fairly unique, and used once per page; others are used more liberally, and built for reuse._

## Tools

Exa is a WordPress theme built for college media. It's built with maintainability and extendibility in mind, and to make it easy for new developers to join the team and get up to speed.

Our setup involves three opensource projects:

### WordPress

We use a self hosted install of WordPress from WordPress.org and hosted on Digital Ocean.

**What you need to know:** If you've never used WordPress start by signing up for an account on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com). Mess around with this blog to learn the vocabulary and conventions that WordPress employs.

### Git

Probably our most valuable tool is Git. We use Git heavily both for source control and to coordinate our development efforts.

Using Git allows us to [host our entire codebase on GitHub](https://github.com/badgerherald/exa). You can even see the files that generate these docs on GitHub [here](https://github.com/badgerherald/exa/tree/master/docs)!

We also use GitHub to [track issues and future development](https://github.com/badgerherald/exa/issues). Doing this allows us to track changes to our docs and keep a record of versions.

**What you need to know:** Git isn't the easiest thing to learn, but it's an incredibly valuable piece of software to learn. There are tons of resources on Google to help you learn, but I'd recommend you start with [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/). This 15 minute tutorial should give you a good idea of how Git works without needing to install anything yourself.
