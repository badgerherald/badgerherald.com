## Docs

If you want to see the docs as a nice hosted localsite, you will need to be build and read them locally. This is fairly straight forward.

`cd` to the folder containing exa and run:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all python requirements for running the docs locally.

Once that is complete, run the command:

	mkdocs serve

And docs should be available at [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) on your local machine. Changes to .md files in `/docs` will instantly refresh in the browser.
